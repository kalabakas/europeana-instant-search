# Europeana instant search (chrome extension)

It is a simple and powerful chrome extension for instant search Europeana items.
It is powered by Algolia [https://www.algolia.com], thus an Algolia index with Europeana records is needed. 
The Europeana Batch Export tool [https://github.com/kalabakas/ebe] can be used to export records through Europena API and feed them in an Algolia index.
